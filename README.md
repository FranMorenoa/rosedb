### rosedb is not production-ready, we are doing more tests now, we recommend you use [LotusDB](https://github.com/flower-corp/lotusdb) instead.

rosedb is a fast, stable, and embedded key-value (k-v) storage engine based on `bitcask`, also supports a variety of data structures such as `string`, `list`, `hash`, `set`, and `sorted set`.
